{"name":"JS Canvas Engine","tagline":"JavaScript game engine for HTML5 canvas element","body":"###Game Engine Made Easy\r\n\r\nJSC Engine (JavaScript Canvas Engine) is a small and easy to use 2D game engine for HTML5 canvas element written in JavaScript.\r\n\r\nIt is so easy to use JSC Engine, that you can create your new game just in several minutes. Have a look at [Quick Start](https://github.com/maxpestun/po-js-canvas-engine/wiki/Quick-Start) guide inside project Wiki.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n###Very Quick Example\r\nIn case you want to test everything by yourself right now just download the whole project and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. There will be a simple shooting game, use keyboard arrows to move the avatar, use left mouse button to shoot. No apache or other web server is required.\r\n\r\n###Another Example\r\nIn case you want to make everything by your own have a look at [Quick Start] (https://github.com/maxpestun/po-js-canvas-engine/wiki/Quick-Start). Below is an example of using JSC Engine in your project (note, `pad` is an ID of the canvas element inside HTML file):\r\n```javascript\r\nvar screenWidth = 800, screenHeight = 600;\r\nvar e = new JSCEngineCreator(\"pad\", screenWidth, screenHeight);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd and draw the object:\r\n```javascript\r\ne.objectAdd({\r\n        id: \"avatar\",\r\n        xPos: 100,\r\n        yPos: 100,\r\n        angle: 0,\r\n        onDraw: function (context, objectData) {\r\n            context.beginPath();\r\n            context.arc(objectData.xPos, objectData.yPos, 15, 0, 2 * Math.PI);\r\n            context.stroke();\r\n            context.closePath();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nProcess the keys:\r\n```javascript\r\ne.keyHandlerAdd({\r\n    keyCode: JSCEngineKeyCodes.right,\r\n    smooth: true,\r\n    onPress: function () {\r\n        e.objectMoveForward(\"avatar\", 5);\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing JSC Engine you can control objects with keyboard and mouse. You can even perform polygonal collision detection and use common functions for image rendering and objects moving so rapidly used in game development.\r\n","google":"UA-43294839-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
